				reportedTo: 'Mrs. Theresa Huber & Mr. Dan Radicia',
				description: 'As a long term substitute for a six-week term I executed both pre-defined and self-planned lessons, graded student assignments, communicated with parents, and collaborated with and sought advice from fellow teachers. I taught lessons and led discussion in To Kill a Mockingbird and Night, integrating academic language templates into formal writing and continuing the teaching of MLA formatted research papers.\nAs day-to-day substitute, I have carried out predefined lesson plans combined with effective classroom management to leave as small a gap as possible in the teacher\'s absence. When possible I also seek out additional ways to support the teacher I substitute for by grading assignments.'

	summary: 'My name is Olivia McElwee. I am an educator with a passion for language and literature. I love being able to inspire students to grow, learn, and mature through engaging lessons. By obtaining a double major, I feel equipped to address the different learning levels and abilities that I may encounter in my classroom. I enjoy learning as much as teaching. I am looking forward to continuing my education, as well as learning new and creative ways to engage students.'
